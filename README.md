what this project is about
This project implements a relational database management system (RDBMS) designed to efficiently manage the core operations of a coffee shop. Developed as part of a beginner-level data engineering course, this DBMS provides a structured approach to store, process, and access critical business data, enabling robust reporting and informed decision-making. The system focuses on tracking products, sales transactions, and related entities such as product types, sales details, customers, staff, and sales outlets.
